====================

Script for OCR parsing of Ingress agent statistics screenshots

### Status
This project is in a early experimental status. Parsing of stats already looks fairly reliable, but needs more testing. See Testing on how to test and help.

### WTF?
This script is inspired by the fantastic agent-stats.com project.
Automated parsing of Ingress agent stats screens would useful for many Ingress related community projects like local competitions.
This project aims to get a reliable base for OCR on stats the agents provide to your project / database.

Be aware that this version is only tested on Ubuntu 14.04.
